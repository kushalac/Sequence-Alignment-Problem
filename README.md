# Sequence Alignment Problem

This project implements two solutions to the Sequence Alignment problem:
1. A basic version using Dynamic Programming.
2. A memory-efficient version that combines Dynamic Programming with Divide-and-Conquer.

## Project Description

The Sequence Alignment problem is solved using two approaches:
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A straightforward implementation that uses a DP table to find the optimal alignment.
- **Memory-Efficient Approach:** Combines DP with Divide-and-Conquer techniques to reduce memory usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
